            At USIP (Undergraduate Student Instrument Project), we turn
            curiosity into innovation. Our program equips undergraduates with
            hands-on experience in Auroral Research using ultralight, low-cost
            instruments deployed from the ground and via weather balloons.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now in its sixth campaign (USIP VI), USIP spans 9-12 credit hours
            and teaches vital skills like leadership, collaboration, research
            techniques, and time management. Students complete the program with
            a research paper, often serving as their thesis or senior project.
            <br />
            <br />
            USIPâ€™s impact is clear: over 100 students have contributed to
            research presented at prestigious conferences(AGU, AHAC, AIAA, etc.)
            , with seven invited papers and one student-authored journal
            article. Our collaborations with initiatives like the Polar Aeronomy
            and Radio Science Summer School, HAARP Winter Campaign, and the
            Nationwide Eclipse Ballooning Project. As well as collaborations
            with universities like University of Fairbanks Alaska (UAF),
            including facilities as Poker Flat Research Range.
